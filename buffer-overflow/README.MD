# Buffer Overflow Demonstration and Explanation

This repository contains the source code and examples used in the article on buffer overflow https://medium.com/gitconnected/buffer-overflow-for-beginners-edf9f9d593e2 . The goal is to provide a practical demonstration of buffer overflow vulnerabilities, explain their mechanisms, and offer insights into mitigating such issues in software development.

## Introduction

Buffer overflow is a common security vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This repository includes examples of:

- Exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- Demonstrating potential risks and consequences.
- Implementing secure coding practices to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

## Code Examples

The repository includes the following:

1. **Basic Buffer Overflow:**
    - A simple example demonstrating an overflow in C.

2. **Exploiting a Vulnerability:**
    - Code showing how an attacker might exploit a poorly secured program.

## Prerequisites

- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC).
- A Linux-based system is recommended for running examples.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational purposes only. The examples demonstrate security vulnerabilities and should not be used maliciously. Use this knowledge to improve software security and protect against similar attacks.
